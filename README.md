### Project Overview

This project is crafted as a full-stack web application, utilizing Microsoft SQL Server for database management, .NET Core 8 for the backend, and React for the frontend, creating a dedicated solution for monitoring and analyzing financial markets. The backend, developed with .NET Core 8, ensures robust data handling and real-time processing capabilities, essential for managing live stock market information from the Taiwan stock exchange.

The frontend is powered by React, designed to offer a seamless user experience by displaying real-time and historical stock data through a dynamic and interactive interface. React's component-based architecture supports modular development and easy maintenance, which is key for creating responsive and engaging user interfaces that allow end-users to interact effectively with complex data visualizations, such as stock price trend charts.

Microsoft SQL Server is employed for its strong data storage and retrieval capabilities, ensuring that stock prices and transaction volumes are meticulously recorded and efficiently accessed for trend analysis. This integration facilitates the effective handling of large datasets, enhancing the applicationâ€™s performance and scalability.
